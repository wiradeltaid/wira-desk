# WDI Daily Autopilot Launch

Composes the autonomous daily engineering routine, verifies or initiates the owner-accepted mandate
required by `wdi-autopilot`, resolves coordinator self code-review and independent peer-review dispatch
from local configuration or agent rules, and launches the execution via `/loop <interval>` (default
`10m`).

`/wdi-daily-autopilot [self-review] [peer] [interval] [--skip-peer-review|--no-review]`:
- `[self-review]` — coordinator self code-review pass model (`default` or explicit model slug; alias `[in-session]`).
  `default` indicates the current coordinating session executes self code-review directly.
- `[peer]` — independent peer reviewer runner or model identifier.
- `[interval]` — optional loop interval matching `^\d+[smhd]$` (e.g., `5m`, `10m`, `15m`). Defaults
  to `10m` when omitted.
- `--skip-peer-review` / `--no-review` — bypasses the secondary peer review pass. MUST NOT disable
  coordinator self code-review, TDD cycles, or automated test suites.

## 0. Precondition

Confirm `.control/registry/index.yaml` exists in the repo root. If it does not, this is not a WDI
Method product repo — report that and stop.

## 1. Parse Arguments and Flags

Parse inputs unambiguously using these rules:
1. Check for review bypass flags: `--skip-peer-review` or `--no-review`. If present, mark peer review
   as bypassed.
2. Check for an interval token matching `^\d+[smhd]$`. If found, assign it to `<interval>`; otherwise
   default `<interval>` to `10m`.
3. For remaining positional arguments:
   - If 1 argument remains: assign to `<peer>`, and default `<self-review>` to `default`.
   - If 2 arguments remain: assign first to `<self-review>` and second to `<peer>`.
   - If 0 arguments remain: read defaults from `.control/custom-dispatch.yaml` if present, else default
     both to `default`.

## 2. Resolve Runner Configuration

Inspect the repository for `.control/custom-dispatch.yaml`:
- **If `.control/custom-dispatch.yaml` exists**:
  Read `runners:`, `roles:`, and `review_policy:`.
  - If `review_policy.peer_review` is explicitly `false`, or if `roles.reviewer` is set to `none`, mark peer review as bypassed.
  - If `<peer>` was not explicitly specified on the command line, use `roles.reviewer`. If resolved `<peer>` is `none`,
    mark peer review as bypassed (coordinator self-review only).
  - If `roles.deep_analyst` is `none`, document review and architecture analysis are handled by the main reviewer or
    coordinator directly, without dispatching a separate deep analyst process.
  - Resolve `roles.builder` for the coding execution inside the active run worktree:
    - `coordinator` (default): coordinating session implements code directly.
    - `in-session`: coordinator delegates coding pass to an in-session subagent (`Agent` tool) in the active worktree.
    - `<runner-id>`: coordinator delegates coding pass to the named external runner spawned with working directory (`cwd`) set to the active worktree.
      If `<runner-id>` is not found in `runners:`, or lacks a nonempty `command` string under `type: shell-out`,
      stop immediately and report to the maintainer (fail-closed; do NOT guess or silently fall back).
      (Note: Synchronous shell-out runners are subject to a 10-minute CLI tool timeout; prefer `in-session`
      for long-running TDD passes or keep ticket slices small).
  - Resolve runner dispatch by `type:`:
    - `auto`: Deterministically evaluates reachability from the active coordinator profile (`$env:CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`)
      before execution. Dispatches in-session via `Agent` if the model is reachable (native Claude); falls back to
      shell-out using `command` if coordinating from a custom gateway/BYOK profile.
    - `in-session`: Dispatches strictly via in-session `Agent` subagent.
    - `shell-out`: Executes the external shell-out `command` (single-string command). If `command` is absent
      or empty, stop and report immediately (fail-closed).
- **If `.control/custom-dispatch.yaml` does not exist**:
  Default `roles.builder` to `coordinator` and resolve dispatch through the caller's active CLI environment.
  - When dispatching a shelled-out `claude` process from a custom API or gateway profile environment,
    ensure the gateway environment variables are cleared so the child process runs with the intended
    target configuration.

## 3. Mandate Verification & Preflight Requirement

Per `wdi-autopilot` § Preflight, unattended loop iterations **require an active accepted mandate** in
`.control/registry/decisions.yaml` whose expiry date has not lapsed. A loop MUST NOT self-authorize
its own mandate.

1. Inspect `decisions.yaml` for an existing decision of `type: mandate` at `status: accepted` with an
   unexpired date.
2. **If no active accepted mandate exists:**
   - Execute `wdi-autopilot` Door 1 (Preflight) in this interactive turn.
   - Present the one-page preflight summary and wait for the owner's explicit confirmation.
   - Once confirmed, write the accepted mandate row into `decisions.yaml` and initialize its ledger.
3. **If an active accepted mandate already exists:** Proceed directly to compose and launch the loop.

## 4. Compose the Routine Mandate

Fill the standing five-point routine template:

```markdown
Execute all FR/Tickets/Specs to completion under the active mandate:
1. Coding & Delegation: <resolved coding execution: author code directly as coordinator | delegate coding pass to in-session subagent in active worktree | delegate coding pass to <resolved builder runner> in active worktree cwd>. Boundary: builder edits application and test files only. Builder MUST NOT commit, push, merge, alter git branches, or write to .control/registry/ or .control/memlog/.
2. Code review: perform code review — self code-review by coordinator, and independent peer review (via <resolved peer command>) [or "peer review bypassed per --skip-peer-review"].
3. Testing & Verification: coordinator alone runs the authoritative test suite (from codebase-stack-guide.md) directly on the active worktree after the coding pass and verifies red-to-green evidence before staging or committing.
4. Reviews and peer analysis: delegate document and architecture review to <resolved peer command> — follow wdi-review criteria for any touched architecture or spec documents.
5. Worktree isolation & Integration: coordinator alone isolates ticket implementation into the run worktree, writes ledger decisions in .control/memlog/, stages/commits, and merges per wdi-autopilot. Peer reviewer inspects the worktree without interfering with active build processes (clause omitted when peer review is bypassed).
```

If peer review was bypassed, replace items 2, 4, and 5 with instructions for the coordinator to perform
direct self-review, self-verification, and sole worktree execution without external peer dispatch.

## 5. Launch

Invoke the `loop` skill with `<resolved interval> /wdi-autopilot <composed text from step 4>`. This
starts the loop execution.

## 6. Verify Immediate Execution

Before finishing, verify that `/wdi-autopilot` was invoked in this same turn for the first iteration
rather than remaining idle until the first cron interval tick. If it did not run immediately, invoke
`/wdi-autopilot` now to start the first iteration.

## 7. Report and Stop

Report the resolved configuration (in-session mechanism, peer review status, active mandate ID, and
loop interval), confirm that the loop is active, and stop. MUST NOT intervene in or micromanage
subsequent loop iterations.
